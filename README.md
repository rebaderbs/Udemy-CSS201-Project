# Udemy-CSS201-Project
CSS201 project for Full-Stack Web Development course via Udemy

Project was to create a web page, specifically a landing page, containing a hero section at the top, navigation bar, logo, links, background image, content, etc. Travel planning is a huge interest of mine so I made a "Visit NYC" website and actually sent it to my spouse. I'd say it was effective, as we visited NYC in June 2022 :)
